# **App Name**: StuHub

## Core Features:

- Student Profile: Centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including conferences and workshops attended, certifications earned, club activities and volunteering efforts, competitions and academic contests, leadership roles and internships, and community services done. This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC ,NIRF, AICTE accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.
- Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities.
- Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars.
- Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.
- Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.
- Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.
- Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.
- Academic Performance: Maintain student attendance, markssheet, calculate sgpa and cgpa, co-curricular and extra activities, club and voluntary events.
- Placement Data: Admin can add and manage the placement data.
